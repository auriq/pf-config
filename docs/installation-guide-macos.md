## First-Time Launch Security Warning

When launching the application for the first time, macOS will display a security warning because the application is not signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate or notarized by Apple.

### Method 1: Using the ZIP Version (Recommended)

The ZIP version is easier to use with macOS security features:

1. Download the ZIP file for your processor (Intel or Apple Silicon)
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Move the "PageFinder Configuration.app" to your Applications folder
4. Right-click (or Control-click) on the application icon
5. Select "Open" from the context menu
6. Click "Open" in the dialog that appears

### Method 2: Using the DMG Version

If you prefer using the DMG version:

1. Download the DMG file for your processor
2. Double-click to mount the DMG
3. Drag the application to the Applications folder
4. In Finder, navigate to your Applications folder
5. Right-click (or Control-click) on "PageFinder Configuration"
6. Select "Open" from the context menu
7. Click "Open" in the dialog that appears

### Additional Security Bypass (If Needed)

If you still can't open the application:

1. Open System Preferences
2. Go to Security & Privacy
3. In the General tab, you may see a message about "PageFinder Configuration" being blocked
